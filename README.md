# README
•	For the first section, we were given a random cod with bugs and we were supposed to fix it. 
•	The codes that we were provided basically played around with an array, copying it to another array, finding min element, max element, average, and sorting the array.
•	I learned that just because it compiles doesn’t mean the program is right.

•	In this section we were assigned to find errors in a code without seeing the actual code
•	The code was a cipher algorithm but it wasn’t perfect. There were multiple errors that we figured out through trial and error.
•	I learned to check edge cases because they need more coding than middle cases, making it more exposed to errors.

•	In this section we were required to code the cipher algorithm from scratch.
•	We used multiple methods of coding the same code.
•	I realized even if the length of a code is same, the run-time can be significantly different.
